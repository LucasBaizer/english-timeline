# What is this?

This is a project I did for my Honors English 10 class as my final project for the year. We were given two weeks to ask 30 questions to a parent or grandparent about something that they lived through, and then create a project based on their answers (such as an artist piece). I am not in any way an artistically inclined person, so after procratinating the project for a while, I came up with the idea to create an interactive web-based timeline. Including the time I spent eating/sleeping/going to the gym today (6/9/19), this project has taken me a total of 11 hours after starting it this morning, and is now finished (until someone finds a bug).

# How to Use

You can compile from source by running `yarn start` or view the EC2 instance at http://54.148.6.70/ which I will use to present it to my class. I did not get an Elastic IP for this instance, so it might change in the future if the instance goes down for any reason.
